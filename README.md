## Hyperion Level 1 Final Capstone Project - On The Line Runners Footwwear Website
#### Overview
In this project, the goal was to display the functionality of various javascript and jQuery functions through the real-world application of a online store website. The website is catered for personalized runners' footwear shopping and has some general information about who the hypothetical store-owners are as well as some fake testimonials. The real user-experience comes into play with the two pages; Catalogue and Shopping Cart. As I was testing and playing around with multiple different tools, there is no real standardization of the functions and I sometimes use different approaches in the script to achieve near-identical goals. This project was a great first stepping stone into the world of Javascript and jQuery.
#### How to install
1. Download the zipped folder into your home directory or any other directory that is easily accessible
2. Extract all the files
3. Double-click on the home-otl.html file which will open the home page of the website in your browser
